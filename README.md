To ensure that the production release will not cause any issues after deployment, you can create the following test cases in the regression framework using Python’s Behave BDD:

1. Data Validation Test Cases:

Row Count Validation:

Validate the row count between the raw CSV file in S3 and the Parquet file after conversion.

Validate the row count between the Parquet file in S3 and the data loaded in Redshift.


Checksum Validation:

Compare checksums of the CSV files and their corresponding .done files to ensure file integrity before conversion.




2. File Format Validation:

Validate that the converted file is in the correct Parquet format with the expected schema and data types.

Ensure that the column names, data types, and order are consistent between the CSV and Parquet files.



3. Data Completeness Test:

Verify that no data is lost or truncated during the conversion from CSV to Parquet.

Ensure that all records from the Parquet file are accurately loaded into Redshift.



4. Redshift Table Data Validation:

Validate the row count between the Parquet files in S3 and the Redshift tables.

Perform data integrity checks to ensure there are no discrepancies between the data in S3 and Redshift (e.g., missing or incorrect values).

Check for specific known data issues, such as duplicate records, null values in mandatory columns, or invalid formats.



5. Schema Validation:

Validate the schema of the Redshift tables, ensuring that the columns, data types, and constraints match the expected schema.

Ensure the Redshift table structure matches any updates or changes after deployment.



6. Data Transformation Validation:

If any transformations are applied during the data load (e.g., derived columns), validate that they are performed correctly.



7. Error Handling and Logging:

Validate that proper error messages and logs are generated when file validation (e.g., row count mismatch, checksum failure) or data loading fails.

Ensure that invalid files or records are appropriately flagged and handled according to business rules.



8. Performance Testing:

Measure the time taken for data conversion (CSV to Parquet) and data load into Redshift.

Ensure that the processing time does not exceed predefined thresholds.



9. End-to-End Workflow Validation:

Validate the entire pipeline from receiving the zipped CSV in the raw S3 bucket to loading data into Redshift, ensuring that each step is executed in sequence without failures.

Perform regression tests to verify that any changes in one step (e.g., schema change, file validation logic) do not impact other steps in the workflow.



10. Redshift Query Validation:

Validate the data using predefined SQL queries to ensure the correct data is loaded into Redshift.

Ensure that important aggregations or calculations (e.g., totals, averages) return expected results.



11. S3 Data Validation:

Validate that the correct files are being picked up from the raw and prep S3 buckets at each stage.

Check for the presence of required metadata (e.g., timestamp, versioning) in S3.



12. Regression Test for Previous Bugs:

Re-run tests that previously failed to ensure that those issues are resolved and do not reoccur after the production release.




Once these test cases are implemented, you can execute the framework in the prep prod environment to ensure the pipeline functions as expected before releasing it to production.



Below are the Behave BDD scenario contents that you can use to create separate Xray tests for each of the mentioned test cases. You can define the required parameters like S3 paths and Redshift tables within the respective test scenarios.

1. Row Count Validation (CSV to Parquet)

Scenario: Validate row count between CSV and Parquet files
  Given the CSV file is located in "s3://bucket-name/raw/path-to-csv-file.csv"
  And the Parquet file is located in "s3://bucket-name/prep/path-to-parquet-file.parquet"
  When the Glue job converts the CSV to Parquet
  Then the row count of the CSV file should match the row count of the Parquet file

2. Row Count Validation (Parquet to Redshift)

Scenario: Validate row count between Parquet file and Redshift table
  Given the Parquet file is located in "s3://bucket-name/prep/path-to-parquet-file.parquet"
  And the Redshift table is "schema_name.table_name"
  When the Glue job loads the Parquet file into Redshift
  Then the row count of the Parquet file should match the row count of the Redshift table

3. Checksum Validation

  Given the CSV file is located in "s3://bucket-name/raw/path-to-csv-file.csv"
  And the .done file is located in "s3://bucket-name/raw/path-to-done-file.done"
  When the checksum of the CSV file is calculated
  Then the checksum of the CSV file should match the value in the .done file

4. File Format Validation (Parquet File)

Scenario: Validate that the converted file is in Parquet format with the expected schema
  Given the Parquet file is located in "s3://bucket-name/prep/path-to-parquet-file.parquet"

  Given the CSV file is located in "s3://bucket-name/raw/path-to-csv-file.csv"
  And the Parquet file is located in "s3://bucket-name/prep/path-to-parquet-file.parquet"
  When the Glue job converts the CSV file to Parquet
  Then all records from the CSV file should be present in the Parquet file without any data loss

9. Error Handling and Logging Validation

Scenario: Validate error handling and logging during CSV to Parquet conversion
  Given the CSV file is located in "s3://bucket-name/raw/path-to-csv-file.csv"
  When there is a row count mismatch between CSV and Parquet
  Then an appropriate error message should be logged, and the file should be flagged as invalid

10. Performance Testing (CSV to Parquet Conversion Time)

Scenario: Validate the performance of CSV to Parquet conversion
  Given the CSV file is located in "s3://bucket-name/raw/path-to-csv-file.csv"

  When specific SQL queries are run
  Then the query results should match the expected values for totals, averages, or other calculations

13. S3 Data Validation (File Presence in Buckets)

Scenario: Validate that the correct files are present in the raw and prep S3 buckets
  Given the raw bucket is "s3://bucket-name/raw/"
  And the prep bucket is "s3://bucket-name/prep/"
  When the data pipeline is executed
  Then the expected files should be present in both the raw and prep buckets with correct metadata

14. Regression Test for Previous Bugs

Scenario: Validate fixes for previous issues during the data pipeline
  Given the previous bug "BUG-ID" occurred in the data pipeline
  When the pipeline is executed again
  Then the bug should not reoccur, and the pipeline should execute successfully

Each of these scenarios can be created as separate Xray tests in Jira, with specific S3 paths and Redshift tables as parameters depending on your project setup.




To implement the above test scenarios in Behave, you will need to create a steps.py file that includes the Python code for each step definition. Below is the implementation for each scenario, leveraging AWS SDK (boto3) for interactions with S3, Glue, and Redshift.

First, ensure you have the required libraries installed:

pip install boto3 psycopg2

Here’s the steps.py file:

glue_client = boto3.client('glue')

    dbname='your_dbname',
    user='your_user',
    password='your_password',
    host='your_redshift_cluster_host',
    port='5439'
)

# Helper function to calculate checksum
def calculate_checksum(file_obj):
    md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
    for chunk in iter(lambda: file_obj.read(4096), b""):
        md5_hash.update(chunk)
    return md5_hash.hexdigest()

# Helper function to get row count from S3 file
def get_s3_file_row_count(bucket_name, file_key):
    s3_object = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_key)
    lines = s3_object['Body'].read().decode('utf-8').splitlines()
    return len(lines) - 1  # Excluding header

# Helper function to get row count from Redshift table
def get_redshift_table_row_count(schema, table):
    query = f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {schema}.{table}"
    cursor = redshift_client.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)
    row_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    cursor.close()
    return row_count

Key Points:

S3 Operations: We use boto3 to fetch files and validate the contents from S3.

Redshift Operations: We use psycopg2 to run SQL queries on the Redshift table.

Performance Testing: We simulate the time it takes to run the job and check if it meets the expected performance.

Error Handling & Logging: A placeholder has been added to check logs (which can be retrieved from CloudWatch).


You can extend the placeholder sections depending on how your actual data pipeline works, particularly for schema validation and error handling.
