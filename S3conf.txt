To configure an AWS Glue job to use the s3a file system in PySpark, you can set the necessary Hadoop configurations within your script. Here's how you can do it:

import sys
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from awsglue.job import Job
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark and Glue contexts
sc = SparkContext()
glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
spark = glueContext.spark_session

# Set Hadoop configurations for S3A
hadoop_conf = spark._jsc.hadoopConfiguration()
hadoop_conf.set("fs.s3a.impl", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem")
hadoop_conf.set("fs.s3a.path.style.access", "true")
hadoop_conf.set("fs.s3a.fast.upload", "true")

# If not using IAM roles, set AWS credentials (not recommended for production)
# hadoop_conf.set("fs.s3a.access.key", "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY")
# hadoop_conf.set("fs.s3a.secret.key", "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY")

# Your Glue job logic here

Important Considerations:

IAM Roles: It's recommended to assign an IAM role to your Glue job with the necessary permissions to access S3. This approach enhances security by avoiding hardcoding credentials.

AWS Glue Managed Dependencies: AWS Glue includes the necessary libraries for S3 access, so you don't need to add external dependencies for hadoop-aws.

Configuration via AWS Glue Console: Alternatively, you can set Hadoop configurations in the AWS Glue console under the "Job parameters" section by adding key-value pairs prefixed with --conf.
